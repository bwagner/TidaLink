- Tempo receivers currently listen on UDP port 6040 (on all interfaces)
- Tempo sender currently listens on UDP port 6041 (on all interfaces)

Currently the tempo sender only sends this message:

- Bundle with timestamp set to the moment when the cps last changed, containing one message:
  - path /tempo
    - [f] floating point beat value when cps last changed
    - [f] floating point cps
    - [s] True if clock is currently paused, False if not (seems to not work yet)

The tempo receivers can send these messages:

- path /cps - cycles per second change, causes new /tempo message to be sent to all receivers
  - [f] the new cps

- path /nudge, nudge phase offset in seconds, causes new /tempo message to be sent to all
  receivers (local to the tempo receivers and not wider link network)
  - [f] nudge value (phase offset, or 0 to reset)
  
- path /ping - causes the /tempo message to be (re)sent to all receivers


======
 TODO
------

[ ] allow cps changes to be scheduled at particular beat values
